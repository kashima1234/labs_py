Yes, he is right, this oak is right a thousand times, thought Prince Andrey, let others, young, again
succumb to this deception, and we know life - our life is over! A whole new set of thoughts
hopeless, but sadly pleasant in connection with this oak, arose in the soul of Prince Andrew. During
this journey he seemed to have rethought his whole life. Came to the same old
reassuring and hopeless conclusion that he did not need to start anything, that he
must live out his life without doing evil, not worrying and not wanting anything.
